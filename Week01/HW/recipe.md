## Description
This **Dubai Chewy Cookie** is one of the most viral desserts in Korea right now, with people waiting six hours in line before opening just to try it. It features a soft, stretchy marshmallow-based chocolate exterior and a rich pistachio kataifi filling that’s nutty and crunchy. At first glance, it almost looks like mochi, but the texture actually comes from *marshmallow*, not rice flour. No baking required, incredibly indulgent, and perfect for gifting or special treats.

## Ingredients
- 150 g kataifi (finely chopped)
- 20 g butter (unsalted)
