        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This <strong>Dubai Chewy Cookie</strong> is one of the most viral desserts in Korea right now, 
            with people waiting six hours in line before opening just to try it. It features a soft, 
            stretchy marshmallow-based chocolate exterior and a rich pistachio kataifi filling that’s 
            nutty and crunchy. At first glance, it almost looks like mochi, but the texture actually 
            comes from <em>marshmallow</em>, not rice flour. No baking required, incredibly indulgent, 
            and perfect for gifting or special treats.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>150 g kataifi (finely chopped)</li>
            <li>20 g butter (unsalted)</li>
            <li>250 g pistachio cream</li>
            <li>200 g marshmallow</li>
            <li>30 g butter</li>
            <li>15 g cocoa powder</li>
            <li>20 g milk powder</li>
            <li>extra cocoa powder (for rolling/dusting)</li>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Finely cut the kataifi strands.</li>
            <li>Melt the butter in a pan over medium heat. Add kataifi and toast, stirring constantly, until evenly golden brown.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a bowl and mix with pistachio cream until fully combined.</li>
            <li>Place the mixture in the freezer for 15 minutes to firm up.</li>
            <li>Divide into 10 equal portions and roll into balls. Place on a tray and refrigerate while preparing the exterior.</li>
            <li>Sift the cocoa powder and milk powder together; set aside.</li>
            <li>In a nonstick skillet over low heat, melt the butter. Add marshmallows and gently stir until about 90% melted.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and immediately add the sifted cocoa and milk powder. Mix until smooth and fully combined.</li>
            <li>Transfer to parchment paper or a nonstick mat and let cool completely.</li>
            <li>Lightly oil your hands. Divide the cooled marshmallow mixture into 10 equal pieces.</li>
            <li>Flatten one piece, place a filling ball in the center, and wrap to seal. Roll gently into a smooth ball.</li>
